Problem: Some keys in ansible_facts contains hyphens.

For example:
"ansible_facts.device_links.ids.sda"  Works, but
"ansible_facts.device_links.ids.dm-0" Doesn't work!
this makes it impossible to select 'dm-0'

```
- name: Entry with hyphen
  debug:
    msg: "{{ansible_facts.device_links.ids['dm-0']}}"
```
